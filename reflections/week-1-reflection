### Week 1 Reflection
This week I worked on creating a sketch involving a cat using basic shapes and positioning. The process helped me slow down and really look at small changes in code affect what appears on the screen. 
One thing I learned is that details matter a lot when coding. Small things like spacing, order, and exact values can completely change the outcome or cause something not to work at all. 
While parts of the sketch were challenging an required trial and error, it was rewarding to see the cat come together even though I am not done yet.
Next I plan to continue refining my skatech and pay closer attention to details while experimenting more confidently.
